# SpaceInvaders
Classic Game Space Invaders

This is a Space Invaders game written in Python using the pygame library.

The project demonstrates the ability to work with the pygame library, as well as the ability to work with modules in Python.

The repository also includes small experimental pygame projects in the following folders: fire_tank_game, goalkeeper, just_screen_game, rocketman, starsky.

The game is launched from the alien_invasion.py file, which initializes the game and interface elements.
